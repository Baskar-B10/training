Microsoft create multiple co pilots like git hub, outlook, windows co pilot

GitHub says it's a world's first at-scale AI developer tool that can help you to write code faster with less work.

Getting your code suggestions, or for advanced code completion. It supports multiple LLM like GPT -3.5, 4, 5
https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison

extension or plugin needed in ID's or editor like Intellj


Modern development:

Accelerated Development
Code quality
leaning Aid (education tool)
collaborative coding 
multi-languages support


Set up:
Need account in GitHub and license 
install IDE
install GitHub plugin in IDE

Modes:

ASK mode - we can ask queries and if we provide context ,it provides response (similar to chatGPT)

Edit mode - copilot can edit the code instead of copy paste. if we provide request it will made the changes.

Agent Mode - recent and powerful one . its combo of ASK and edit mode. we provide request , it will make changes and review the work like developer.it can run on terminal 
https://github.com/features/copilot/plans
In IDE, chat panel , select the mode and LLM models

Interacting with copilot:

Inline suggestions: when we type code in IDE, copilot gives suggestion
copilot chat: using chat box
Inline Chat: chat enable while coding in IDE, context specific 
comments to code: comments to code 

write comments on class it converts to code
ASK mode , we ask to explain the workspace

select the snippet , it will add as context else it will take full class as context for any changes we need

Prompt Engineering:

how to give clear instruction to AI, we need to know prompt engineering

process of crafting clear instruction to guide AI systems like copilot to generate context appropriate 

ensures syntactically , functionally and contextually correct

Principles:
1.Single- ask one thing at a time to copilot
2.specific- instruction should be clear and detailed
3.short- specific brief but short. not to write story
4.surround- descriptive file name like .csharp , .java , keep open relevant file

Best Practices:
1. Provide enough clarity
2. provide enough context with details
3. provide example for learning

Techniques:
1. zero-shot learning - no examples , just comment
2. one-shot learning - single example given
3. Few-shot learning - several example 

To create new project :
open ASK mode in copilot chat 
type @workspace/new and provide the context like simple console application with tech details

User prompt process flow:
1.Secure prompt transmission and context gathering - send the details securely 
2. Proxy-filter - like firewall , will detect any suspicious activity and block
3. Toxicity-filter - repones will not provide response like personal information , address, id, hate speech , inappropriate content even if we provide it as context , it will filter out all that 
4. code generation with LLM - LLM will generate code using context
5. Post processing and response validation- again filter activated and check toxicity and remove and proxy will ensure code security
6. suggestion delivery and feedback loop initiation- learn and improve from user suggestion
7. repeat for subsequent prompts- ongoing interaction and response

we can use copilot in git hub page also not only in editor

commit message and description for pull request , also avail the copilot review in pull request


Copilot for Backend development:
 faster, cleaner and more consistent code by auto suggesting logic , API routes , database queries.

1. generate API endpoints
2. Database operations
3. error handling and logging
4. unit tests

Copilot for front end development:
building UI components quickly
suggesting html css layouts
writing java script/typescripts logic
integrating frontend frameworks
generating form validations , event handlers 

best practices:
write clear comments or prompts
review suggestions carefully
use it to scaffold not finalize
be specific in your code context

what not to do:
don't treat copilot as a source of truth - always verify logic and performance
avoid using copilot for security-sensitive without close review
don't rely on copilot to handling edge cases- handle them explicitly 


Challenge 1: Build a User Login Form in React

Task1: Initialize the sample folder structure for react application using Copilot

Task2: Build the UI components for login form and User page.

Task3: Add the validation for the Login form.

Task4: Make UI customizations (eg: Theme update, background color change)

Task5: Analyze and document code using GitHub Copilot

Devops and CI/CD automation with copilot:
1. copilot can setup IAC (Infrastructure as code) - install terraform plugin in IDE, ask agent for ARM template for deploying azure app service
2. building yaml pipelines with copilot for building code , running tests , packaging and deploying


design document using copilot:
 helps write plantUML /mermaid code for sequence class , ER diagram
generates schema definitions for ERD based designs

Management and customization with copilot :

explore plans and its features
1. Management policies 
2. security and privacy 
3. plan selection consideration


Ip Indemnity : intellectual  property protection , GitHub will take care of legal responses
data protection agreement : formal agreement about data protection and compliance . so ensure data is protected.
GitHub copilot trust center: hows it works including security , privacy compliance  and intellectual property safeguards.

manage content exclusions:
1. configure content exclusion for repo
	repo settings
	exclusion paths
2. configure content exclusion for organization
	organization settings
	exclusion details
3. Impact of content exclusion
	code completion 
	chat responses
