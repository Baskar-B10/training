Day 1:
Cloud computing

delivery -delivery of computing services - server , storage , DB , networking , software
cloud- delivery of services is done over internet 
payment mode- pay how much used 
allows for faster innovation 

Application
manage servers , storage , networks , data centers and software's runs

traditional Data centers:
less management, investment , operations and focus on business

cloud service models:
Infrastructure as service
platform as services
software as services


Public cloud:
Investment - no need capital investment, Pay as you go model
management- no need to manage underlying physical 
reachability- can be there across worlds  
easy of use

Private Cloud:
mostly running apps for business or organization
control
security 
data 
flexibility 

Hybrid cloud:
combo of both public and private cloud
current investment
extension 
data
migration

economies of scale
basics- ability to carry our tasks more efficiently or lower cost per unit when operating at large scale
discount- demand increases, get hardware at discount prices 
benefit- discounts passed to customer
service cost- number increases, cost decreases

cost :
server cost, storage cost , software support 
data center cost -cooling

Benefits :
scalability
disaster recovery - east / west US region to keep VM and storage accounts
Elasticity: scale based on demand 
fault tolerance

Day 2:

Microsoft Azure
1 Service
2 subscription 
3 resource
4 resource group

Azure Architecture and services - Azure compute

1. Virtual Machine - allows to host the VM without need of buying and maintaining physical hardware
VM services:
a) compute
b) operating system 
c) lifecycle 
d) workload
VM Advantages:
less management 
less investment 
less operation 
configure
VM Deployment: 
Virtual network 
public Ip address
network security group
OS Disk
VM Types:
General purpose
compute optimized
memory 
storage 
VM cost:
subscription , Virtual network , network interface , Network security group - free of cost
VM running , OS Disk and public IP - pay 
explore Pricing options : pay as go , Azure saving plan , reserved instance and spot
VM shutdown or deallocation - only de allocation , we wont pay , shutdown VM still pays

Availability Sets:
protect your machines against infrastructure failures.

How it works:
create fault domains- common power supply
update domains- reboot if VM is down 

Availability Zones:
 availability of app by protecting from datacenter failures 

Azure Dedicated Host:
running physical server on data center

VM scalability:
resize VM size (increase CPU size)- vertical scaling/scale up 
add more VM - horizontal scaling/scale out 

Azure Web APP:
An Azure App Service Plan defines the compute resources for hosting your web apps, APIs, or other services in Azure. This guide explains how to manage and configure App Service Plans using the Azure CLI.
service plans:
free, shared
basic, standard premium
isolated

Day 3:

rules we can define 

Application Security Groups: extension of NSG . 

Connectivity:
Virtual Network Peering:

one Virtual network in one machine and other in other machine . each isolated in nature, we can cant connect to each private Ip's. so we use Virtual network peering to connect the virtual network in same or across region

ExpressRoute

Distribute incoming load traffics for backend machines
Feature:
Pricing 
SLA
Backend machines
support for zone
components :

Day 4:
Azure Storage :
store as Blob, queue , file and table

Blob storage - large amount of structured data as binary data

create storage containers, inside that create blob

File service: hosting file shares on cloud, mount on windows, Linux and MAC

Queue Storage:
storing large amounts of message
access by HTTP/HTTPS protocols
Message driven/decoupling architecture
Use service bus storage to store queue.
transaction triggers message to queue , multiple listener will be there to pickup to process. once processed only we can delete the message in queue.

In payment we use queue based until transaction process , message will be there in queue.

Table Storage:
Non relational structured data. 
store as key value pair

Data storage prices: premium , hot , cool and achieve
access tiers: set the rules to define the access tier. hot, cool, cold  and achieve
hot- data accessed frequently
cool- data accessed infrequently and stored at least 30 days
cold -data accessed infrequently and stored at least 90 days
achieve- data accessed infrequently and stored at least 180 days


Data Redundancy
locally redundant storage - single physical location
zone redundant storage- stored across 3 availability zone in primary region
geo redundant storage- data copied synchronously 3 times within physical region using LRS, then copies asynchronously to single physical location in secondary region
geo zone redundant storage- copied synchronously across 3 availability zones in primary region using ZRS. then asynchronously 
to single physical location in secondary region

data center region down means , go for geo redundant storage. in case of disaster recovery , one region goes down, get from other region. 
geo zone redundant storage- it can recovery from own region from different data center from same region. then it checks on other data region.

Azure File sync:
sync commonly accessed files onto local window server, so user can fetch from local machine to avoid latency in accessing files
